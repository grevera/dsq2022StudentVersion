<p> Dou Shou Qi V3 <br/>
    Note: This is an individual (not a team) assignment. </p>

<p> Make a backup copy of your work so far before you begin this assignment. </p>

<p> Your job is to complete the todo's for v3 (version 3) of the game in Board.java. Continue to use
    Android Studio for your code. Follow instructions carefully as your code will be tested in an
    automatic testing framework:
<blockquote>
    Use only these rules for game play (no variations except for the one noted below):
    http://veryspecial.us/free-downloads/AncientChess.com-DouShouQi.pdf.
    <br/><br/>
    Required variation (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_(board_game)): "All traps are
    universal. If an animal goes into a trap in its own region, an opponent animal is able to
    capture it regardless of rank difference if it is beside the trapped animal." This avoids the
    known draw described in http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/shoudouqi2.html.
    <br/><br/>
    Clarification: Do not allow moves/captures where the attacker "loses." For example, do not allow
    the mouse to attack the lion and "lose" to the lion on purpose and be removed. As much as
    possible, use the functions that you have already defined.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p> Deliverables: Submit your work (Board.java and a brief zoom video of you playing the game) via
    Canvas. You can play your game by simply running MVC.java. Make sure that you thoroughly test
    your code as upper management in the company that you work for surely will. (They have nothing
    better to do, except for endless meetings and coming up with new employee training modules &
    initiatives. For examples, search 'gsk values.') </p>
