<p> Dou Shou Qi V1 <br/>
    Note: This is an individual (not a team) assignment. </p>

<p> You just started working for the Generally Hectic (GH<sup>&trade;</sup>) 
    game company when the lead developer for a new game quits. Fortunately 
    (or maybe unfortunately), only the framework for the game has been 
    developed so far. Your job is to complete the todo v1's in Board.java to
    complete v1 (version 1) of the game. You will complete the following 
    functions: Board, getPiece, getBoard, and toString. </p>

<p> You must use Android Studio for your code as that is the official IDE 
    used at Generally Hectic. Follow instructions carefully as your code 
    will be tested in an automatic testing framework. See Board.java for 
    more details and for links to details about game play. You may obtain a
    copy of the start code by either cloning the github repository or
    obtaining a zip file from github (click on the green Code button in
    github).  Only complete v1 for now (management is still making changes,
    and you know how they can be). </p>

<p> Deliverables: Upload your work (Board.java) into Canvas (as directed in
    Canvas). Make sure that you thoroughly test your code as upper management
    in the company that you work for surely will. </p>
