<p> Dou Shou Qi V6 <br/>
    Note: This is an individual (not a team) assignment. </p>

<p> Make a backup copy of your work so far before you begin this assignment. Complete the todo's for
    v6 (version 6) of the game in Board.java. </p>

<p> This assignment continues to tie together all of your hard work so far and relies heavily on the
    existing functionality. Our goal is to add some basic game AI. To accomplish that, we generated
    a list of all possible moves from the current configuration in the previous exercise. Now, we
    will develop a way to pick and choose from the list that you created in the last exercise. You
    can either use this as a way to "suggest" one move to the current player (a hint), or you can
    use it for the computer adversary against a human player, or you could potentially have the
    computer play against itself. To accomplish this, complete the chooseBest function in
    Board.java. </p>

<p> Deliverables: Submit your work (Board.java) via Canvas. </p>
