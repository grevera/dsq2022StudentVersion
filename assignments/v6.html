<p> Dou Shou Qi V6 <br/>
    Note: This is an individual (not a team) assignment. </p>

<p> Make a backup copy of your work so far before you begin this assignment. Complete the todo's for
    v6 (version 6) of the game in Board.java. </p>

<p> This assignment begins to tie together all of your hard work so far and relies heavily on the
    existing functionality. Our goal is to do some basic game AI. To accomplish that, we need to
    generate a list of all possible moves from the current configuration. In the future, we will
    develop a way to pick and choose from the list but for now, all we need is a complete list. To
    accomplish this, complete the suggest function in Board.java. </p>

<p> Your solution may be as elegant or as "brute force" as you wish. You should use your existing
    functions as much as possible (however, you are not required to do so). Your copy ctor will
    definitely be useful! You can also use your toString to print out the elements of your list (to
    check your work). I used doMove in my solution a great deal as well. Your list should only
    contain "legal" moves for the current player's turn. </p>

<p> You might be wondering how we might use this in an actual game. One way is to give the user a
    "hint" or "cheat" option. The user can ask the computer to show a list of all of the possible
    moves starting with the current board. Then the user can pick one of those moves. Another option
    is for the computer to be an adversary. When it is the computer's turn, the computer generates a
    list of possible moves and then picks one at random. Of course, that is not a very good
    adversary. In the future, we will explore how to evaluate the elements of the list and choose
    the best. </p>

<p> You may also be wondering how I can test/evaluate your results. I generate a list of all
    possible moves from a starting board position. You do as well. Now I need a method to compare
    your list with mine. One way to do that is to use the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient">Sorensen-Dice
        coefficient.</p>
