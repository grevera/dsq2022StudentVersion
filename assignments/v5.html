    Note: This is an individual (not a team) assignment. </p>

<p> Make a backup copy of your work so far before you begin this assignment. </p>

<p> Complete the todo's for hashCode() and gameOver() for v5 (version 5) of the
    game in Board.java. Notes:
    (a) Use the string algorithm from wikipedia. It is available in the
    file, 'Java hashCode() - Wikipedia.pdf'.
    (b) Simply treat the individual piece values (i.e., piece[r][c].ordinal())
    as the individual character values. (DO NOT use charAt on the string
    returned from toString for this function.)
    (c) Also include the value of mBlacksTurn as described as the last (i.e.,
    nth) value. Use the int value 1 for true and 2 for false.
    (d) DO NOT include anything else (just the piece array contents and then bluesTurn).
    It quickly becomes too complicated.
    (e) Also, don't forget to modify doMove to call gameOver.
    (That's because you shouldn't be allowed to make moves after the game is over!)
</p>

<p> (Not required.)
    You might be wondering how you can test your hashCode function. Create
    your own separate file with you own separate hashCode function. This
    should take a string and return your calculated h.c. value (using charAt()
    for each of the individual int string char values). Check if you calculate
    the samme value as Java does for your string. Test it on a variety of
    strings.
