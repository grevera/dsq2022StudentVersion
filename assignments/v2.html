<p> Dou Shou Qi V2 <br/>
    Note: This is an individual (not a team) assignment. </p>

<p> Make a backup copy of your work so far before you begin this assignment. </p>

<p> You continue working for Generally Hectic. (The economy is slow and you can't find a better
    employer.) Your job is to complete the todo's for v2 (version 2) of the game in Board.java. (You
    must continue to use Android Studio for your code as that is the official IDE used at Generally
    Hectic. Follow instructions carefully as your code will be tested in an automatic testing
    framework.) </p>

<p> Deliverables: Submit your work (Board.java and a screenshot of your using Android Studio) via
    Canvas. Make sure that you thoroughly test your code as upper management in the company that you
    work for surely will. (They have nothing better to do, except for endless meetings and coming up
    with new employee training modules & initiatives. For examples, search 'pfizer values.') </p>
